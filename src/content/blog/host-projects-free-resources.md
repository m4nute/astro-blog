Hey! Today I'm gonna share with you lots of platforms to ship any side-project, or even a Landing Page or SaaS completely for free. No need to spend any ðŸ’² on it. Let's begin!

### I'm talking about:

- Frontends
- Backends & Docker Images
- BaaS (Backend as a Service)
- Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLite)
- Auth
- CronJobs
- Emails
- And more!

<br>

## Frontends

### [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

You can create unlimited projects using Next.js, React, Astro, SvelteKit, Vue... Basically anything. It should be enough for all of your side-projects. One-click deployments also!

### [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

Similar to Vercel. Probably the closest alternative out there.

There's other alternatives as **AWS Amplify**, **Railway** or **Render**. If you're trying to host static options there are a bunch of free options such as **Github Pages**.

<br>

## Backends & Docker Images

### [Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/)

In my opinion, Koyeb is really good if you want to deploy Python APIs based on frameworks like FastAPI, Flask and Django. You can also host Node.js and Bun here.

### [Railway](https://railway.app/)

Provides a limited free tier. After adding a billing method, unlocks a bunch of new features and free $5 USD of credits per month. Great for hosting small or even medium API's and databases. Be aware of not surpassing the free credits or you'll get charged.

### [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)

Fly.io provides a scaling plan. It requires a billing method, but provides three VM's that could be useful for small apps or experiments. Be aware of not surpassing the free credits or you'll get charged.

<br>

## Backend as a Service

### [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)

Most respected in the community. Good free tier, comes with other features as Auth,Realtime and file storage. PostgreSQL Wrapper, but you can also use only the cloud Postgres instance and the file storeage if needed.

### [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/)

Still in development but pretty cool. SQLite Wrapper, there's no cloud solution. You have to self-host it.

<br>

## Databases

This is probably the best section of this guide and the one you need most.

<br>

### PostgreSQL

<br>

#### [Neon](https://neon.tech/)

Serverless PostgreSQL, good free tier.

<br>

#### [Cockroach DB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/pricing/)

Great free tier.

<br>

#### [Xata](https://xata.io/)

Great free tier, innovative AI integration.

### MySQL

<br>

#### [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/pricing)

One of the best options out there. Great free tier, but requires Credit Card and only let's you create one database for free.

### SQLite

<br>

#### [Turso](https://turso.tech/pricing)

Offers the best free tier. Unlimited databases, up to 3 locations, branches...

### Redis

<br>

#### [Upstash](https://upstash.com/)

Only Redis provider that offers a competitive free tier for now.

<br>

## Auth

### [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)

Good free tier, highest quality solution right now. Be aware of the insane prices after the free tier, huge vendor lock-in. I personally recommend it for personal projects that won't scale, just to save time.

### [Kinde](https://kinde.com/)

Great free tier, a bit cheaper compared to Clerk.

<br>

## CronJobs

### [QStash](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/overall/getstarted)

Serverless solution provided by Upstash, good free tier.

### [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs)

Much more limited free resources. Might be convenient if you're already hosting on Vercel and just need a simple cron-job.

<br>

## Emails

### [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)

SendGrid offers a free forever plan with 100 emails/day. Pretty decent to start.

### [MailerSend](https://www.mailersend.com/pricing)

SendGrid alternative. 3000 monthly emails offered for free.

<br>

## [Github Students Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) (Bonus: Only for students)

This pack offers a bunch of free stuff, that you wouldn't get free access to otherwise. You only need an email from an educational institution.

### Domains

The pack comes with 3 free domains for 12 months:

- .tech
- .live
- .me

If you're trying to host your own portfolio or blog with a nice domain you can pick the _.me_ one. That's what I did!

### Cloud Hostings

<br>

#### Digital Ocean

With the pack, you get a full year free to use the included $200 in credits.

<br>

#### Heroku

You get $13/month for **TWO** whole years. The amount of credits is not amazing tho, you'll only be able to purchase small instances.

### Dev Tools

<br>

#### Github Copilot

Yep, you get free copilot as long as you have the students pack.

<br>

#### JetBrains

Pretty well known IDEs. The license lasts for a year but you can renew it if you still hold the students pack.

<br>

### API's & Infra

<br>

#### MongoDB Atlas

You get $50 in credits for free and a ~~$150~~ certification is included.

<br>

#### Stripe

Waived transaction fees on first $1000 in revenue processed. Really nice if you're starting your SaaS.

<br>

#### Mailgun

20,000 free emails per month for a whole year. Great as well if you're starting your SaaS or newsletter.

That's it! You can do anything for free right now. All types of databases, domains, auth... Literally anything! And without spending a single cent.
