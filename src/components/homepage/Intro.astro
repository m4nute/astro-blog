<p>
  👋🏻 Hello, I'm Manu. I've loved puzzles and problem-solving since I was a kid, and never got tired of it. After coding everyday for the past 18
  months, I've encountered hundreds of challenges and learned about things I didn't even know existed. The thrive to gain knowledge is what makes
  software exciting for me. I'm currently open to new opportunities, so feel free to contact me through mgudinocontacto@gmail.com or Linkedin!
